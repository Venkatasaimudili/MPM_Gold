# MPM_Gold
A hybrid MPM framework combining WGAN-GP CNN, and FKELM tackles imbalanced, uncertain datasets in gold exploration. Applied to G.R. Halli, India, it achieved high accuracy (AUC > 0.97), generated mineral prospectivity maps, and identified four gold targets aligning with known mineralization and anomalies.
